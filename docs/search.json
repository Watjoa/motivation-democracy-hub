    "text": "Concept note\n\n\nPurpose\nThe Hub curates datasets, metadata, and reproducible code connecting democratic quality, psychological need dynamics, well‑being, and civic attitudes. It offers public aggregates for transparency and governed access for partner microdata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRationale\n\n\n\nDemocracies aim to create conditions for human flourishing, yet democratic discontent is rising. By mapping when systems support or thwart citizens’ needs, we clarify why democracies sometimes enhance mental health—and why, under threat, citizens may prefer autocratic solutions.\n\n\n\nScope\n\nDatasets: cross‑national surveys; national panels; experiments; validated short scales.\nMetadata: codebooks, translations, invariance reports, sampling frames, weights, changelogs.\nAnalytics: preregistered pipelines for harmonization, SEM/MLM, experiments, visualization.\nAccess: public aggregates + restricted microdata (DTA/DTUA).\nGovernance: authorship/citation norms, ethics & GDPR templates, annual DOI releases."
